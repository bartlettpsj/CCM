User:
Produce a central configuration server system that stores all configs inside Zookeeper and allows a different configuration per project and then environment, such as Dev, QA, Stg, and Prod. Must be accessible via RESTful API. Configurations are stored and accessed down to individual values such as app.endpoint.timeout and app.endpoint.url.

Assistant:
To create a central configuration server system that stores configurations in Apache Zookeeper and allows for different configurations per project and environment (e.g., Dev, QA, Stg, Prod), while being accessible via a RESTful API, we can design the system as follows:

System Design

Zookeeper Data Structure:
Configurations are stored in a hierarchical structure in Zookeeper.
The structure is organized by project and environment.
Example ZNode structure:
Copy
/configs
/{project}
/{environment}
/app.endpoint.timeout
/app.endpoint.url
/other.config.key
Example:
Copy
/configs
/myapp
/dev
/app.endpoint.timeout = "5000"
/app.endpoint.url = "https://dev.api.example.com"
/qa
/app.endpoint.timeout = "3000"
/app.endpoint.url = "https://qa.api.example.com"
RESTful API:
The API allows clients to:
Retrieve configurations for a specific project and environment.
Retrieve individual configuration values.
Update configurations (if authorized).
Example endpoints:
GET /config/{project}/{environment}: Retrieve all configurations for a project and environment.
GET /config/{project}/{environment}/{key}: Retrieve a specific configuration value.
PUT /config/{project}/{environment}/{key}: Update a specific configuration value.
Configuration Server:
A server application (e.g., built in Java, Python, or Node.js) interacts with Zookeeper to read and write configurations.
The server exposes the RESTful API for clients to access configurations.
Authentication and Authorization:
Secure the RESTful API with authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
Restrict write access to authorized users (e.g., admins).
Caching:
Cache configurations in memory to reduce latency and avoid frequent Zookeeper reads.
